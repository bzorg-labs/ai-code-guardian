# AI Code Guardian

AI Code Guardian is a simple tool that checks and validates
AI-generated code before it gets merged.

## Why this exists

AI can write code.
But it can also introduce:
- breaking changes
- risky imports
- unnecessary complexity

This project is about **verification, not generation**.

## Current focus

- Python files
- CLI-based workflow
- Human-readable reports

## Philosophy

LLMs suggest.
Systems decide.

## Status

🚧 Very early stage  
Built step by step, in public.
